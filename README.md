<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial we will be doing some configuration activities with network security groups and observing network traffic between Azure Virtual Machines using Wireshark, gaining intuition on how different protocals such as ICMP, SSH, DHCP, DNS, and RDP work.




<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 11 
- Ubuntu Server 24.04

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

<p>
</p>
<p> To get this excercise started, first you will need to create a resource group and two Virtual Machines on Azure, a windows 11 VM and an ubuntu linux vm. Ensure that the vnet and resource group are the same for both with at least 2 vcpus each. Install windows app (microsoft remote desktop) and connect to the windows vm, now install Wireshark using windows-vm to start a packet capture. Now we will filter for ICMP Traffic, a protocal used by used by ping to the test connectivity between two devices.

We can inspect each individual packet and see the actual data that is being sent in each ping. the picture below demonstrates just that.

In the next portion of the lab we will perpetually ping the Linux machine with the command ping -t. This will continually ping the machine until we decide to stop it, while the Windows machine is pinging the Linux machine we will go to the Linux machine and block inbound ICMP traffic on it's firewall. Once we do that we will stop recieving echo replys from the Linux machine. We will block ICMP by creating a new Network Security Group on the Linux machine that will be set to block ICMP. We can allow the traffic by allowing ICMP on the Linux Network Security Groups page on Azure.

<p>
Next we will use our Windows machine to SSH to the Linux machine. SSH has no GUI it just gives the user access to the machines CLI. We will set the wireshark filter to capture SSH packets only. When we ssh into the Linux machine with the command prompt "ssh labuser@10.0.0.5" we can see that wireshark starts to immediately capture SSH packets.

</p>
<p>
Now we will use wireshark to filter for DHCP. DHCP is the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol this works on ports 67/68. It is used to assign IP addresses to machines. We will request a new ip address with the command "ipconfig /renew". Once we enter the command wireshark will capture DHCP traffic.

<p>
Time to filter DNS traffic. We will set wireshark to filter DNS traffic. We will initiate DNS traffic by typing in the command "nslookup www.google.com" this command essentially asks our DNS server what is google's IP address.

<p>
Lastly we will filter for RDP traffic. When we enter tcp.port==3389 traffic is spammed non stop because we are using Remote Desktop Protocol to connect to our Virtual Machine.
